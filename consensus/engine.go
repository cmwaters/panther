// In order to function it depends on a networking implementation that completes
// the Gossip interface, a state machine for building, verifying, executing and
// persisting data and an optional signer which is necessary as a writer
// in the network to sign votes and proposals using a secured private key
//
// The engine runs only in memory and is thus not responsible for persistence and crash
// recovery. Each time start is called, a height and state machine is provided
